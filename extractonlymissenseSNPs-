# Title: Extract and Count Missense SNPs from VCF Files
# Author: Gerald Mboowa
# Description: This script extracts shared polymorphisms (missense SNPs) from multiple VCF files using BCFTools and Bash commands.
# It also counts specific polymorphism types (e.g., missense SNPs) for downstream analysis.

# Start timing the script execution
start_time=$(date +%s)

# Step 1: Set the working directory
# Ensure this script is run from the directory where your VCF files are located.
echo "Setting the working directory..."
cd /path/to/your/working/directory || { echo "Error: Directory not found!"; exit 1; }

# Step 2: Verify BCFTools installation
# Check if BCFTools is installed; if not, prompt the user to install it.
if ! command -v bcftools &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: BCFTools is not installed. Please install it before running this script."
    exit 1
else
    echo "BCFTools is installed."
fi

# Step 3: Process each VCF file
# Replace "list_of_vcfs.txt" with the name of a file containing a list of VCF filenames (one per line).
echo "Processing VCF files to extract missense SNPs..."
while IFS= read -r vcf_file; do
    # Check if the VCF file exists
    if [[ ! -f "$vcf_file" ]]; then
        echo "Error: VCF file $vcf_file not found. Skipping."
        continue
    fi

    # Extract missense SNPs from the VCF file
    echo "Extracting missense SNPs from $vcf_file..."
    output_file="${vcf_file%.vcf}_missense_snps.vcf"
    bcftools view -i 'TYPE="snp" && INFO/ANN ~ "missense_variant"' "$vcf_file" -o "$output_file" -Ov
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "Error: Failed to extract missense SNPs from $vcf_file."
        continue
    fi

    # Count the number of missense SNPs
    missense_count=$(grep -c "missense_variant" "$output_file")
    echo "Number of missense SNPs in $vcf_file: $missense_count"

    # Save the count to a summary file
    echo "$vcf_file: $missense_count missense SNPs" >> missense_snp_summary.txt
done < list_of_vcfs.txt

# Step 4: Summarize the results
echo "Summarizing results..."
if [[ -f missense_snp_summary.txt ]]; then
    echo "Summary of missense SNP counts:"
    cat missense_snp_summary.txt
else
    echo "No missense SNPs were identified in the processed files."
fi

# End timing the script execution
end_time=$(date +%s)
execution_time=$((end_time - start_time))
echo "Script completed in $execution_time seconds."

# Notes:
# - Ensure the list_of_vcfs.txt contains one VCF filename per line.
# - Modify the working directory path (cd command) to the appropriate location.
# - Install BCFTools if not already installed using: brew install bcftools (macOS) or apt install bcftools (Ubuntu).
